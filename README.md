# Movie-Recommended-ChatBot
A Movie Recommendation Chatbot is an AI-powered system that helps users find movies based on their preferences and interests. With the vast number of films available on various streaming platforms, users often face difficulty selecting what to watch. This chatbot simplifies the decision-making process by offering personalized recommendations using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Built using Python, the chatbot integrates collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques to deliver accurate movie suggestions. The system can interact with users via text or voice commands and provide real-time recommendations based on their past choices, ratings, and search history.
